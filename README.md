# [@hipDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/hipDonaldTrump)
A simple Twitter bot that adds modern slang to Donald Trump's tweets in real time. Created for an art performance project.

Built using [twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit), a Twitter API client for Node.js. Deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).

### Project Aim

The reason I decided to “impersonate” Donald Trump using ridiculous and unintelligent language is because he is often accused of making ridiculous and unintelligent statements.

**There arises this distinction between content and the how that content is presented.**

Hip Donald Trump blends the two together by presenting content that can be perceived as absurd and unqualified in a language with the same impression.
